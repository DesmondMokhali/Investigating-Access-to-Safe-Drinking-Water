# Project Overview: Investigating Access to Safe Drinking Water

This project investigates access to safe and affordable drinking water, focusing on inequalities in service levels between different countries and regions. It analyses data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) to answer questions regarding inequalities in access to safe drinking water.

## Key Points:

- **Data:** WHO/UNICEF JMP data on access to drinking water (2000-2020)
- **Focus:** Inequalities in access to safe drinking water across countries and regions
- **Analysis:**

### Part 1:
- Comparing world population estimates with JMP data to understand the bigger picture.
- Analysing the distribution of urban vs. rural populations.
- Identifying trends and patterns in water access across different regions.
- Comparing access measures across various types of areas.
- Analysing national, urban, and rural access to water based on population size.
- Investigating the impact of population size and urbanization on income and water access.

### Part 2:
- Comparing the imported dataset with JMP data to ensure consistency.
- Identifying the years represented in the data and calculating the average year difference per country.
- Calculating the Annual Rates Change (ARC) for national, rural, and urban areas.
- Analysing changes in access to basic water over time for different areas.
- Comparing ARCs between rural and urban populations and across different regions.
- Investigating how national population size influences the ARC.

## Project Goals:

- Gain insights into global access to safe drinking water.
- Identify inequalities in access between countries and regions.
- Analyse trends and changes in access over time.
- Contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean water and sanitation for all.
